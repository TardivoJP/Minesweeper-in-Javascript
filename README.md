# Minesweeper in Javascript

Just a simple project to try and recreate the Minesweeper in Javascript, although once again certainly not as pretty.

The current implementation is an absolute mess logic wise, barely working and cobbled together with duct tape.

I need to study graphs or other neighbor detection algorithms to actually implement this properly.

Will update it soonâ„¢.
